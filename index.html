    <h1>Collatz Visualization</h1>

    <p>The following two charts visualize Collatz paths.  Surprisingly
        interesting patterns emerge.  The charts are independently
        scrollable.</p>

    <p>The upper chart plots Collatz paths on a log scale.  Each path starts
        from the integer shown in the top left corner of the chart, and
        continues until 1 is reached; at which point, the next path is
        plotted.</p>
        
    <p>As paths are completed, their lengths are plotted on the lower chart. 
        The resulting image begins as two "forks" at the left end of the chart,
        and evolves into widening radial arcs.  Intensity (on a gray scale)
        shows how far each path wanders from its start point, as a multiple of
        the initial value.</p>
